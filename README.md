## 2-Approximation for TSP

## Description
A 2-approximation algorithm for tsp that uses minimum spanning trees to approximate the length of a tsp journey through a complete graph that follows the triangle approximation

## Usage
In order to run this program please use: 
    g++ -std=c++11 greedy_tsp.cpp 

If you would like to use your own test cases, please place them to the same folder as greedy_tsp.cpp and add the text file name to the files vector in the main function.

## Generating New Test Cases
If you would like to generate new test cases, please refer to the sample code on the project 4 report which explains how to generate complete graphs that obey the triangle inequality.
